          Full stack web developer with over a decade background in sales.<br/>
          Completing the Full-Stack bootcamp program at the University of
          Adelaide has provided me with valuable skills in JavaScript, MERN,
          React.js, relational databases and a core understanding of the need
          for, and implementation of, responsive design. I hope to bridge the
          communication gap between software developers and stakeholders within
          and outside the company, using my sales experience as bedrock for
          clear and concise communication. I am passionate about ongoing
          personal development and learning, which is particularly important in
          the software and web development, as technologies rise and fall in an
          instant.
